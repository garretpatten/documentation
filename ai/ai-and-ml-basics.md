## Vectorization & Embedding

Imagine you have a library with a vast collection of books. Each book is unique and contains different topics, genres, and writing styles.

- Vectorization: Think of vectorization as a way to turn each book into a barcode. This barcode is a unique combination of lines and spaces that represents the bookâ€™s contents in a numerical form. Just like a barcode can be scanned to get information about a book, a vector can be used by a computer to understand the information and relationships of data.
- Embedding: Now, imagine you want to organize these books on shelves so that similar books are placed near each other. Embedding is like mapping these barcodes to specific locations on the shelves. Books about similar topics or written in a similar style end up close to each other. This spatial arrangement makes it easy to find related books quickly. In the same way, embedding organizes data points in a space where similar points are near each other, making it easier for a computer to find and work with related data.

So, vectorization creates a unique barcode for each book, and embedding arranges these barcodes in a meaningful way on the shelves.
