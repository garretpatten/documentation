# Intro to Defensive Security

- Defensive security is concerned with two main tasks:
    - Preventing intrusions from occurring
    - Detecting intrusions when they occur and responding properly
- Security Operations Center (SOC) - a team of cyber security professionals that monitors the network and its systems to detect malicious cyber security events
    - Vulnerabilities
    - Policy Violations
    - Unauthorized Activity
    - Network Intrusions
- Threat Intelligence --> Thread Informed Defense
- Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)
- Digital Forensics in Defensive Security:
    - Intellectual Property Theft
    - Cyber Espionage
    - Possession of Unauthorized Content
- Digital Forensics materials:
    - File System
        - Installed Programs
        - Created Files
        - Partially Overwritten Files
        - Deleted Files
    - System Memory
    - System Logs
    - Network Logs
- 4 Major Phases of Incident Response
    - Preparation
    - Detection and Analysis
    - Containment, Eradication, and Recover
    - Post-Incident Activity
- Malware
    - Virus: a piece of code that attaches itself to a program
        - It is designed to spread from one computer to another
        - it works by altering, overwriting, and deleting files once it infects a computer
    - Trojan Horse: a program that shows one desirable function but hides malicious function underneath
    - Ransomware: a malicious program that encrypts the user's files
        - Encryption makes the files unreadable without knowing the encryption password
        - The attacker offers the user the encryption password if the user is willing to pay the ransom
- Malware Analysis:
    - Static analysis of the program without running it
        - Usually requires knowledge of assembly language
    - Dynamic analysis of the program running in a controlled environment where it is monitored
- A Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system gathers security-related information and events from various sources and presents them via one system
- There are many open-source databases out there where you can perform a reputation and location check for IP Addresses
    - AbuseIPDB
    - Cisco Talos Intelligence
