# Linux Fundamentals

- The name "Linux" is actually an umbrella term for multiple OS's that are based on UNIX (another operating system)
    - Because UNIX is open-source, variants of Linux come in all shapes and sizes - suited best for what the system is being used for
- The first linux release was in 1991
- Shell Operators:
    - `&` - This operator allows you to run commands in the background of your terminal
    - `&&` - This operator allows you to combine multiple commands together in one line of your terminal
    - `>` - This operator is a redirector (meaning that we can take the output from a command -- such as `cat` to output to a file -- and direct it elsewhere)
    - `>>` - This operator does the same function of the `>` operator but appends the output rather than replacing (meaning nothing is overwritten)
