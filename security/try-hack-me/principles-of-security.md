# Principles of Security

- The CIA triad is an information security model that is used in consideration throughout creating a security policy
    - This model has an extensive background, ranging from being used in 1998
- Consisting of three sections: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA), this model has quickly become an industry standard today
- Whilst the three elements to the CIA triad can arguably overlap, if even just one element is not met, then the other two are rendered useless (similar to the fire triangle)
    - If a security policy does not answer these three sections, it is seldom an effective security policy
- Confidentiality: This element is the protection of data from unauthorized access and misuse
    - Organizations will always have some form of sensitive data stored on their systems
    - To provide confidentiality is to protect this data from parties that it is not intended for
- Integrity: The CIA triad element of integrity is the condition where information is kept accurate and consistent unless authorized changes are made
    - In the CIA triad, integrity is maintained when the information remains unchanged during storage, transmission, and usage not involving modification to the information
    - Steps must be taken to ensure data cannot be altered by unauthorized people (for example, in a breach of confidentiality)
- Availability: The main concern in the CIA triad is that the information should be available when authorized users need to access it -- in order for data to be useful, it must be available and accessible by the user
    - Availability is very often a key benchmark for an organization
    - When a system is unavailable, it often results in damage to an organization's reputation and loss of finances
    - Availability is achieved through a combination of many elements, including:
        - Having reliable and well-tested hardware for their information technology servers (i.e. reputable servers)
        - Having redundant technology and services in the case of failure of the primary
        - Implementing well-versed security protocols to protect technology and services from attack
- The levels of access given to individuals are determined on two primary factors:
    - The individual's role/function within the organization
    - The sensitivity of the information being stored on the system
- Two key concepts are used to assign and manage the access rights of individuals, two key concepts are used:
    - Privileged Identity Management (PIM): used to translate a user's role within an organization into an access role on a system
    - Privileged Access Management (PAM): management of the privileges a system's access role has
- The Bell-La Padula Model is used to achieve confidentiality
    - The model works by granting access to pieces of data (called objects) on a strictly need to know basis
    - This model uses the rule "no write down, no read up"
- The Bell LaPadula Model is popular within organizations such as governmental and military
    - This is because members of the organizations are presumed to have already gone through a process called vetting (a screening process where applicant's backgrounds are examined to establish the risk they pose to the organization)
- The Biba model is arguably the equivalent of the Bell-La Padula model but for the integrity of the CIA triad
    - This model applies the rule to objects (data) and subjects (users) that can be summarized as "no write up, no read down"
    - This rule means that subjects can create or write content to objects at or below their level but can only read the contents of objects above the subject's level
- The Biba model is used in organizations or situations where integrity is more important than confidentiality
- For example, in software development, developers may only have access to the code that is necessary for their job (they may not need access to critical pieces of information such as databases, etc)
- Threat modeling is the process of reviewing, improving, and testing the security protocols in place in an organization's information technology infrastructure and services
    - A critical stage of the threat modeling process is identifying likely threats that an application or system may face, the vulnerabilities a system or application may be vulnerable to
- The threat modeling process is very similar to a risk assessment made in workplaces for employees and customers. The principles all return to:
    - Preparation
    - Identification
    - Mitigations
    - Review
- It is, however, a complex process that needs constant review and discussion with a dedicated team. An effective threat model includes:
    - Threat intelligence
    - Asset identification
    - Mitigation capabilities
    - Risk assessment
- Threat Modeling frameworks:
    - STRIDE (Spoofing identity, Tampering with data, Repudiation threats, Information disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privileges)
    - PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)
- A breach of security is known as an incident
    - Actions taken to resolve and remediate the threat are known as Incident Response (IR) and are a whole career path in cybersecurity
    - An incident is responded to by a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) which is prearranged group of employees with technical knowledge about the systems and/or current incident
