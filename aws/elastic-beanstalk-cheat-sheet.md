- **Elastic Beanstalk** handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring.
- When you want to run a web application but you don't want to have to think about the underlying infrastructure
- It costs nothing to use Elastic Beanstalk (only the resources it provisions, e.g. RDS, ELB, EC2)
- Recommended for test or development apps; not recommended for production use
- You can choose from the following preconfigured platforms: Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker
- You can run containers on ED either in Single-container or Multi-container, these containers are running on ECS instead of EC2
- You can launch either a **Web Environment** or a **Worker Environment**
    - **Web Environments** come in two types: **Single-Instance** or **Load Balanced**
        - **Single-Instance Environment** launches a single EC2 instance, an EIP is assigned to the EC2
        - **Load Balanced Environment** launches EC2 instances behind an ELB managed by an ASG
    - **Worker Environments** create an SQS queue, install the SQS daemon on the EC2 instances, and has ASG scaling policy which will add or remove instances based on queue size
- EB has the following **Deployment Policies**:
    - **All At Once** takes all servers out of service, applies changes, puts serves back in service
        - Fast, but has downtime
    - **Rolling** updates servers in batches
        - Reduced capacity, based on batch size
    - **Rolling with Additional Batch** adds new servers in batches to replace old
        - Never reduces capacity
    - **Immutable** creates the same amount of servers and switches all at once to new servers (and removes old servers)
- Rolling deployment policies require an ELB, so it cannot be used with Single-Instance Web Environments
- In-Place deployment is when deployment occurs within the environment (all deployment policies are In-Place)
- Blue/Green is when deployment swaps environments (outside an environment)
    - When you have external resources such as RDS which cannot be destroyed, it is suited for Blue/Green
- `.ebextensions` is a folder which contains all configuration files
- With EB, you can provide a **Custom Image** which can improve provisioning times
- If you let Elastic Beanstalk create the RDS instance, that means when you delete your environment, it will delete the database
    - This setup is intended for development and test environments
- `Dockerrun.aws.json` is similar to an ECS Task Definition files and defines multi container configuration
