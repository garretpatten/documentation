## Module 1: Security Overview

- AWS is responsible for the security OF the Cloud, and customers are reponsible for security IN the Cloud
  - Exactly where the line is drawn between AWS's and the customer's responsibility can depend on the service being consumed
- Security services (up to customer to use/enable):
  - AWS Inspector
  - AWS Guard Duty
  - AWS Cloud Trail: monitors API calls and user activity within your account
  - KMS: encryption
  - Firewalls, etc
- Self-Managed Service vs AWS-Managed Service
  - Self-Managed DB on EC2, you're responsibe for:
    - Backups
    - High Availability
    - OS upgrades
    - Service/image upgrades
    - Fault tolerance
    - Security
    - etc
  - AWS-Managed Service
    - Allows you to create an identical instance where AWS handles all of the above sub-bullets for you
- **Wherever possible, use an AWS-Managed Service**
- **Wherever possible, make use of a serverless service**
- AWS Cloud Adoption Framework
  - A set of rules/ideas critical for cloud adoption
  - Control and governance for the Cloud
- AWS Well-Architected Framework: [Framework Pillars](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/the-pillars-of-the-framework.html)
  - Guidelines and best practices for AWS Cloud deployment
  - 6 Pillars (along with some examples)
    - Operational Excellence
      - Deploying infrastructure as code
    - Security
      - Apply security at all layers
    - Reliability
    - Performance Efficiency
    - Cost Optimization
    - Sustainability
- Security is like an onion
  - There are many layers
  - As you get closer to the center, the security gets tigher
  - Security should be applied thoughtfully at each layer
- NIST CSF (National Institute of Standards & Technology Cyber Security Framework)
  - Designed to be size, sector, and country agnostic
  - References globally accepted standards, guidelines, and practices
  - Organizations across the world can use it to efficiently operate in a global environment
- 3 A's of Security
  - Authentication (Who You Are)
  - Authorization (What You Can Do)
  - Accounting (Logs - What You Did)
- CIA Triad AWS Examples
  - Confidentiality: EBS encryption
  - Integrity: Cloud Trail log file validation
  - Availability: ELB
- Global Concerns:
  - AWS WAF
    - Deny (based on IP source)
    - SQL Injection prevention
    - XSS prevention
    - User-agent blocking
    - Bad bot blocking
    - Content scraper blocking
  - Amazon Route 53
    - AWS DNS
      - Route based on origin location of DNS query
        - Can block requests from certain geographic locations
      - Route to static or dynamic resources
  - Amazon CloudFront
    - AWS CDN
      - Can configure allow or block lists for different regions/countries
  - Amazon Edge locations
- All the above services under Global Concerns sit outside the VPC and falls under the customer's responsibilty; your VPC (LAN) is managed by AWS though
- In the Cloud:
  - Network ACL (Access Control List)
    - Deny or block by IP
    - Use port blocking
  - Security Groups
- Diversified Security Layers
  - Apply many layers of controls
  - Target distinct layers with distinct controls
  - Use different technologies
- It is customer's responsibility to understand what controls are available, understand what's important to their app, choose the right controls, and deploy them properly
- Only AWS contracted auditors are allowed to access AWS data centers
  - If your company has a need to audit data center for secure storage purposes, AWS gets audited every 6 months and provides artifacts and reports to facilitate downstream auditing by consumers
- AWS Trusted Advisor will scan you infrastructure and make recomendations around:
  - Cost optimization
  - Performance
  - Security
  - Fault Tolerance
  - Service limits
  - Operational excellence

## Module 2: Securing the Network

- VPC: Network architecture is your foundation
  - Good design builds in security
  - Customers have full control over their VPC
  - Stakeholder input helps develop the strategy
- Every VPC must have a CIDR range
  - Once you've created your primary CIDR, it cannot be modified
    - You can add more IP addresses, but that will overcomplicate your routing
    - It is very important to think ahead and allocate the proper number of IP addresses when creating your primary CIDR range
- **Always use a `/16` for your CIDR range (which will give you 65,000 or so IP addresses)**
- You segregate IP addresses by creating subnets
- When a subnet is created, AWS will create a NACL (firewall at subnet level)
  - Can then create a security group in the subnet around your resource to only allow inbound traffic to a specific port
- **Use subents to group the tiers of your application (for example, web/app/db within a single VPC)**
- **Avoid opening SSH or RDP for instances in production environment wherever possible**
  - Use SSM instead
- Designing a Network
  - Monitor at boundaries
  - Subet to create isolation
  - Connect through Firewalls and Load Balancers
- Inside VPC
  - Plan for unique CIDR range for each VPC
  - Use RFC 1918 addressing (class A/B/C)
  - Plan for growth ...
- Outside the VPC
  - ...
- Amazon Route 53 using DNSSEC
  - Domain Name Security Extensions (DNSSEC) helps prevent DNS attacks like DNS cache poisoning and DNS spoofing
    - Sign public hosted zones or use DNSSEC validation
    - Store private keys in AWS KMS
    - Use a single key across multiple public hosted zones
- Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall
  - Define domain name filtering rules to control access to sites and block DNS-level threats
  - Customize the responses for blocked DNS queries
  - Filter on a domain ...
  - ...
  - ...
  - Firewall Manager
- Overall guidance
  - Layer security groups and NACLs together
  - Use multiple AZ deploymnents and ELB for high availability
  - Use out-of-band management whenever possible
    - SSM instead of SSH
  - Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor your VPC components
  - Use flow logs to caputre information about traffic in your VPC
  - Always use IAM to limit access to your resources, including the VPC and related components
- Network filtering methods
  - Stateless
    - Focus on content in packets
    - Use info from headers
    - Generally fast and has no issue with heavy traffic loads
    - NACLs

## Stateful

- Rules in NACL apply in order
  - If Deny Any Any first and then Allow HTTPS Any, all traffic will be denied
  - If order is reversed, HTTPS will be allowed in, but other protocols like HTTP will not
- Network ACLs
  - Remember the default NACL (Allow Any Any)
  - Monitor and audit network ACLs for ineffective "Deny" rules
  - Consider limitations
  - Do not ignore outbound rules on network ACLs
- Must allow UDP for DNS
- When a subnet is created, a default Security Group is created
  - Permits all inbound traffic from members of Security Group
  - Permits all outbound traffic
- Custom Security Group
  - Permits no inbound traffic
  - Permit outbound traffic
- Security Groups Best Practices
  - Never keep unattached security groups
  - Track rate of change in production environments
  - Ensure that security groups do not have a large range of ports open
  - Use security groups with ELBs, to restrict access to the internet
  - Limit modifications to only certain IAM roles
  - Do not ignore outbound rules of security groups
- **Only ever open the REQUIRED ports**
- A good pattern for secure infrastructure is where:
  - You have a single public subnet with a load balancer
  - You have a web server in a private subnet
  - A security group allows HTTPS to public subnet and out to web server subnet
  - Another security group allows for inbound traffic to web server in private subnet from public subnet's load balancer
  - Optionally, you could move everything down and only have a NAT in the public subnet which then points to a Load Balancer in a private subnet that then forwards traffic to web server in same private subnet
- If you must utilize SSH, use a Bastion Host in a public subnet that bounces you to the desired server
- AWS Network Firewall is a managed protection service that provides:
  - Stateful firewall
  - Web filtering
  - Intrusion protection
  - Central management and visibility
  - Rule management and customization
  - Partner integrations
- For SSM usage, must allow HTTPS outbound to facilitate SSM Agent to connect with Systems Manager
  - SSM is still widely used for AWS Systems Manager, but it really stands for Simple Systems Manager which is the deprecated service that predated AWS Systems Manager
- SSM access must be granted separate from any related service permissions (i.e. If a user has Full EC2 Access, they will need SSM permissions to actually SSM into that EC2)
- Shield Response Team (SRT)
  - Shield Advanced includes the option to receive proactive support from the SRT
  - Helps mitigate risk of DDoS...

## Module 3: Amazon EC2 Security

- Common Vulnerabilities
  - Unintentionally exposing EC2 instances to the public
  - Sensitive information in metadata
  - Unused or unneeded services or software
  - Outdated or nonpatched OS or installed software
  - Application configuration weaknesses (such as startup and configuration scripts containing sensitive information)
  - Overly permissive identity and access management policies
- Hardening your Systems
  - Changing default passwords
  - Remove or disable unnecessary software
  - ...
  - ...
  - ...
  - ...
- You can access Volumes in Console and create Snapshots even if they are attached to an instance that is currently running
- The snapshot can then be used to create an Amazon Machine Image
- AMI Catalog (My AMIs section) will display the AMIs that you have created
- All snapshots are stored in an S3 bucket by default
  - When you create a snapshot, a new bucket is created to hold that snapshot
  - Snapshot buckets are hidden by default (even to `root`) so you cannot change configuration of bucket and make it publicly available
  - The only way you can access snapshot buckets is via the snapshot API
- Delete unneeded snapshots as they do cost money
- 3 Services for Securing Your Workload
  - AWS Systems Manager
  - Amazon Inspector is used for vulnerability scanning
  - AWS Config is used to alert on configuration changes
- AWS Config can detect changes to things like Security Policies that in turn set off alams that trigger emails to relevant parties
  - Provides a detailed view of the resources associated with your AWS account:
    - How they are set up
    - How they relate to each other
    - How that has changed over time
- Keys are region specific in AWS
  - The alias may be shared, but the underlying keys will be specific to the region
- Encryption by default is a best practice to ensure security of data at rest
  - Encryption by default is a region-specific settings
  - You can launch an instance only if the instance type supports Amazon EBS encryption
  - When migrating servers using AWS Server Migration Services (SMS) do not turn on encryption by default
- Key stuff
  - ...
- Management
  - Limit access and authorization for connecting to instances (Session Manager)
  - Securely manage instances at scale using the Run command
  - Regularly patch and updated with defined maintenance windows (Patch Manager)
  - Automate monitoring and remediation of configuration drift (State Manager)
  - Secure, monitor, and rotate secrets (Secrets Manager)
- Can store more secrets in Secrets Manager compared with AWS Parameter Store (although, there is a cost associated with that increased capability)
- Amazon Inspector scans:
  - EC2
  - ECR images
  - AWS Lambda functions
- Amazon Inspector integrates with AWS Organizations, AWS Security Hub, and Amazon EventBridge
- AWS Config automatically discovers and records state and configuration resources
  - Track changes (collect a historical record of changes)
  - Evaluate config
  - Automate remediation activities
  - Create real-time alerts using Amazon SNS and Amazon EventBridge
- **Enable AWS Config in all accounts and regions and record configuration changes to all resources types**
- Record global resources only in 1 region
- Amazon cerifies and provides some AMIs, community AMIs are not certified by Amazon though and they are therefore not recommended
  - If you are going to use a community AMI, test it in a non-production account first

## Module 4: Monitoring and Alerting

- VPC Flow Logs capture:
  - Packet metadata
  - Source IP
  - Destination IP
  - Address
  - Ports
  - Protocol
  - Packet size
  - Other metadata
- They cannot monitor packet contents (payload or application layer data)
- They are not real-time, they use aggregation interval for capture
- They monitor network traffic in and out of:
  - VPC
  - Subnets
  - ENI (Elastic Network Interfaces)
- They are enabled under VPCs > Select VPC > Flow Logs tab
- Traffic Mirroring for detecting network and security anomalies
  - Extract traffic of interest and route it to detection tools of your choice (like copying traffic to a Forensics box in a different subnet)
- Whether using Console, CLI, or something else, everything boils down to API calls in AWS
- Cloud Trail monitors all API calls and user activity and writes encrypted logs to an S3 bucket
- `root` can terminate AWS accounts/organizations, but admin users cannot
  - Best practice to create an admin user to use instead of `root`
- Use a dedicated S3 bucket for storage of Cloud Trail logs with MFA enabled
  - `root` user must have an MFA device set up and MFA enabled in order to enable MFA on resources like the Log S3 bucket
- Limit access to the AWSCloudTrail_FullAccess policy
  - Maybe 1 or 2 people having full access while others have just read access
- CloudTrail Lifecycle Management is configured through S3
  - Can conditionally transition to different storage tier
    - After X days, move logs to Y storage
      - Can utilze Glacier deep archive storage
- Integrate Cloud Trail with Cloud Watch
  - Monitor and alert on specific events
  - Simple searching is provided
  - Use AWS Config to ensure CloudTrail is sending events to CloudWatch Logs
    - Can fire Lambda function to reenable CloudTrail if it is ever disabled
- CloudWatch is one of the most important (if not THE) services to provide us visibility into our environment
  - It is agent-driven
  - Agents can monitor resources for various criteria and fire SNS alerts to specific parties when specific conditions are met
    - For example, if CPU utilization is 80+% for over 20 minutes, notify Ops team via email
  - CloudWatch can also fire off processes other than SNS alerts to send emails (run a lambda, for example)
- CloudWatch is Big Brother (it monitors the entire environment)
- AWS Athena is a powerful tool for analyzing and querying your log data
  - Uses SQL queries
- IoC
  - Abnormal high CPU
  - Sudden increases in db reads
  - HTML response sizes
  - Mismatched port-application traffic
  - Unusual DNS requests
  - Unusual outbound network traffic
  - Anomalies in privileged user account activity
  - Geographical irregularities (source of traffic)
  - Unusually high traffic at irregular hours
  - Multiple, repeated, or irregular login attempts
- Can use these Indicators of Compromise and use them to fire off alerts and processes to keep your system secure
  - If a privileged user has tried logging in from an unexpected country or many times or in any suspicious manner, can fire a lambda to disable that user account
- There are specific CloudWatch Alarms AWS recommends as Best Practices
  - Reference in slide deck
- Guard Duty is another great security service similar to AWS Inspector
- AWS Inspector is like someone that comes into your house and looks for possible vulnerabilities from within
- Guard Duty is like someone standing outside that is actively looking for all suspicious activity/traffic/anomalies in your environment (Intrusion detection services)
  - No agents, no sensors, no network appliances to install
  - Malware protection
  - Built-in anomaly detection with machine learning
  - Monitors up to 5,000 member accounts
  - One-click activation
- Guard Duty uses logs from VPC FLow Logs, DNS logs, Aurora, CloudTrail, KDS audit logs, S3 events, etc as data sources and uses analysis/machine learning on those logs to generate High/Medium/Low findings
- AWS customer had no changes but bill doubled; after enabling Guard Duty, they realized that an insider had installed a crypto miner, malicious files in an EC2 instance; trojans, SSH brute forcing, DNS data exfiltration were all detected automatically as well
- AWS Security Hub provides automated security checks for various standards (PCI compliance and AWS Foundational Security Best Practices, for example)
- Manual remediation is slower than automatic remediation (consider an issue that arises at 2am)
  - Manual remediation should be used to test new automatic remediations before they are put into production
- Automatic remediation prevents impact radius from growing
  - You can write simple rules to indicate events you are interested in and specify automated actions for when an event matches a rule
- Automate, automate, and automate some more!
- AWS Audit Manager continuously audits your AWS usage to simplify how you assess risk and compliance
  - Use Evidence Finder to select evidence and then generate report and it will be automatically stored in an S3 bucker
- If Block Public Access is not enabled on a bucket, it will still deny traffic by default if no policy is present
  - If a policy is configured, then certain operations will be explicitly allowed or denied
