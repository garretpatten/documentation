# Basics
- Different linux distros use different kernel versions
- Different kernel versions have different levels of support for hardware
- New hardware requires drivers to be written for them to connect the hardware with the kernel
    - Newer laptops will likely have newer hardware which may require new drivers to be written to support that hardware
    - If the hardware is too new, no kernel version will support it or only very recent kernel versions will support it
        - With various linux distros consuming various linux kernel versions, it's important to understand the hardware of the machine that linux will be installed on - it may call for a minimum version of the linux kernel which will limit the distros that support the hardware
