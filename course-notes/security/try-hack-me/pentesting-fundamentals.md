# Pentesting Fundamentals

- A Penetration test or pentest is an ethically-driven attempt to test and analyze the security defenses to protect these assets and pieces of information
  - A penetration test involves using the same tools, techniques, and methodologies that someone with malicious intent would use and is similar to an audit
- Companies that provide penetration testing services are held against legal frameworks and industry accreditation
- Hackers are sorted into three hats, where their ethics and motivations behind their actions determine what hat category they are placed into:
  - White Hat: These hackers are considered the "good people," they remain within the law and use their skills to benefit others
  - Gray Hat: These people use their skills to benefit others often; however, they do not respect/follow the law or ethical standards at all times
  - Black Hat: These people are criminals and often seek to damage organizations or gain some form of financial benefit at the cost of others
- The ROE (Rules of Engagement) is a document that is created at the initial stages of a penetration testing engagement consisting of 3 part:
  - Permission: This section of the document gives explicit permission for the engagement to be carried out. This permission is essential to legally protect individuals and organizations for the activities they carry out.
  - Scope: This section of the document will annotate specific targets to which the engagement should apply. For example, the penetration test may only apply to certain servers or applications but not the entire network.
  - Rules: The rules section will define exactly the techniques that are permitted during the engagement. For example, the rules may specifically state that techniques such as phishing attacks are prohibited, but MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks are okay.
- The steps a penetration tester takes during an engagement is known as the methodology
- Pentesting Methodology Stages:
  - Information Gathering: This stage involves collecting as much publically accessible information about a target/organisation as possible, for example, OSINT and research
  - Enumeration/Scanning: This stage involves discovering applications and services running on the systems
  - Exploitation: This stage involves leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application
  - Privilege Escalation: Once you have successfully exploited a system or application (known as a foothold), this stage is the attempt to expand your access to a system.
    - You can escalate horizontally and vertically, where horizontally is accessing another account of the same permission group (i.e. another user), whereas vertically is that of another permission group (i.e. an administrator)
  - Post-Exploitation
    - Pivoting
    - Additional Information Gathering (as Privileged User)
    - Covering Tracks
    - Reporting
- The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM): a detailed framework of testing strategies for systems, software, applications, communications, and the human aspect of cybersecurity
- The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) framework is a community-driven and frequently updated framework used solely to test the security of web applications and services
- The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework: a popular framework used to improve an organizations cybersecurity standards and manage the risk of cyber threats
- The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF): an extensive framework of fourteen principles used to assess the risk of various cyber threats and an organization's defenses against these
  - The framework mainly focuses on and assesses the following topics:
    - Data Security
    - System Security
    - Identity and Access Control
    - Resiliency
    - Monitoring
    - Response and Recovery Planning
- There are three primary scopes when testing an application or service:
  - Black-Box: No Knowledge
  - Gray-Box: Partial Knowledge
  - White-Box: Full Knowledge
