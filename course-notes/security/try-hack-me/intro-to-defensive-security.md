# Intro to Defensive Security

- Defensive security is concerned with two main tasks:
  - Preventing intrusions from occurring
  - Detecting intrusions when they occur and responding properly
- Security Operations Center (SOC) - a team of cyber security professionals that monitors the network and its systems to detect malicious cyber security events
  - Vulnerabilities
  - Policy Violations
  - Unauthorized Activity
  - Network Intrusions
- Threat Intelligence --> Thread Informed Defense
- Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)
- Digital Forensics in Defensive Security:
  - Intellectual Property Theft
  - Cyber Espionage
  - Possession of Unauthorized Content
- Digital Forensics materials:
  - File System
    - Installed Programs
    - Created Files
    - Partially Overwritten Files
    - Deleted Files
  - System Memory
  - System Logs
  - Network Logs
- 4 Major Phases of Incident Response
  - Preparation
  - Detection and Analysis
  - Containment, Eradication, and Recover
  - Post-Incident Activity
- Malware
  - Virus: a piece of code that attaches itself to a program
    - It is designed to spread from one computer to another
    - it works by altering, overwriting, and deleting files once it infects a computer
  - Trojan Horse: a program that shows one desirable function but hides malicious function underneath
  - Ransomware: a malicious program that encrypts the user's files
    - Encryption makes the files unreadable without knowing the encryption password
    - The attacker offers the user the encryption password if the user is willing to pay the ransom
- Malware Analysis:
  - Static analysis of the program without running it
    - Usually requires knowledge of assembly language
  - Dynamic analysis of the program running in a controlled environment where it is monitored
- A Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system gathers security-related information and events from various sources and presents them via one system
- There are many open-source databases out there where you can perform a reputation and location check for IP Addresses
  - AbuseIPDB
  - Cisco Talos Intelligence
